# About the project

## Context

This site is a simple react app I made to learn react.

## Made with 

This app is made with react, written in typescript and uses class based react components. It uses the [pokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get the data on the pokemons
 
## Features

You can play the game of finding which pokemon is behind the shadow. The site displays your best streak (since the launch of the page) and your current streak. 

You can also choose the generation of the pokemon you will have to find. 

You can enter the name of the pokemon in all the languages : 

- `en`
- `es`
- `de`
- `fr`
- `it`
- `ja`
- `ja-Hrkt`
- `ko`
- `roomaji`
- `zh-Hans`
- `zh-Hant`
